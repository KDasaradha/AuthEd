AuthEd is an interactive educational platform designed to help users understand and implement various authentication methods. It provides clear explanations, visual diagrams, and code examples to make learning about authentication concepts accessible and practical.

## Features

Based on the project blueprint (`/docs/blueprint.md`), AuthEd aims to provide the following core features:

- **Interactive Diagrams:** Visualize authentication flows for different methods.
- **Code Examples:** See practical implementations in various languages or frameworks (currently focused on web).
- **Comparison Tools:** Understand the pros and cons of different authentication types side-by-side.
- **Security Considerations:** Learn about common vulnerabilities and best practices.
- **User Authentication Type Data:** Detailed information on various authentication methods.

## Technologies Used

AuthEd is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
